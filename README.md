Documentation for CSci 5105 Publish-Subscribe Messaging System
Author: Joey Engelhart, engel429

# System Description:

This is a simple publish subscribe messaging system that uses UDP and Java RMI to communicate.

The API allows client applications to remotely Publish(), Subscribe(), Join(), Unsubscribe(), Leave() and Ping().

## Client Structure

The client is relatively simple. Upon construction, it initializes a listener thread that listens on a UDP socket for messages from the remote server. It attempts to initialize remote communication with the specified
remote server. Upon successful completion of all startup routines, the spins an additional thread that enters
a ping() loop to indicate its continued operation to the remote server with which it has established communication.

## Server Structure

The remote messaging server has more moving parts. Upon initialization, the server creates a Coordinator singleton, which serves as the gateway/dispatcher for the system. 

### Coordinator

The Coordinator is constructed to perform as little work as possible, so as to avoid being a bottleneck
for the system. Whenever a client Join()s, it adds that client's map that maps IP/Port to a ClientManager
for that Client. When a subsequent remote invocation for that client arrives, it simply looks up the ClientManager for that client, creates a new task for that ClientManager on the task queue, and immediately
returns success or failure to the client.

### ClientManagers and the Thread Pool Executor

The task queue is managed by a thread pool executor service. The basic structure is the following: after
looking up the correct ClientManager for that client, it adds a task to the Thread Pool for that ClientManager that is appropriate to the API call made by the client. If the Client called Publish(...), e.g., a call to clientManager.publish(...) will be added to the task queue. When a thread becomes available
for that task, it is immediately executed by the appropriate clientManager. This structure allows us to scale
out as needed when demand increases, because the Thread Pool adjusts its size to the demand.

### Communicating with the MessageStore

ClientManagers maintain subscription lists as well as past publications for its client. When a publish(...)
task is executed, the client manager communicates with the MessageStore to add the new publication, if it
doesn't already exist.

Retrieving subscriptions utilizes a pull approach: a single pullScheduler thread periodically wakes up and
adds a retrieve(...) task to the Thread Pool Executor for given ClientManagers. When a thread is available
for that retrieve(...) task, the ClientManager for that task asks the MessageStore for all matching publications that arrived after the last publication the ClientManager retrieved (which the ClientManager
keeps track of). Once retrieved, the ClientManager sends these back to the client.

### Messages, Protocols, and Matching

The entire system is defined generically, in the following sense: the protocol used for sending,
interpreting, and storing messages is injected as a parameter at the time of initialization. There are
three classes that support this structure: Message, Protocol, and Query. The effect of these three classes
is that you can completely changed the sending, interpreting, and storing format of all communication by
simply instantiating and injecting a different Protocol at initialization.

Matching in the MessageStore proceeds by a set-theoretic logic. The MessageStore is a ConcurrentHashMap that stores a String as its key. That key is a field-value combination for a given field in the Message's Protocol for the system. For example, a key can exist for "type_Sports" or "org_UMN". The values for the MessageStore's map is a PublicationList.

Every Message, publication or subscription, contains a Query. A query will store the appropriate key-value Strings under which that Message is categorized (e.g., "type_Sports" if the type for that message is sports) for each field in the protocol. A publication is added to a key's publication list if one of these field-value pairs of the Message match that key. Thus a reference for the publication "Sports;Me;UMN;content1" will be added to "type_Sports", "orginator_Me", etc.

Upon retrieval, we simply use the subscription Message's query to retrieve the publications that match that query's field-value pairs. We take the intersection of the publications matched from each of those keys, and return them to the client. This is fast because we only retrieve publications from a PublicationList that arrived after the lastReceived for that query field, and because these lookups are fast. We use TreeSets to hold the matches, so intersecting is reasonably fast as well (i.e., through O(logn) contains()).

#Comparison to Google PubSub:

The implementation of Google PubSub was significantly easier. What was between 1000-2000 lines of Java code became 100 or so lines (albeit with less functionality). It seems that the concept of a Topic is an additional helpful abstraction. I also think one simple structural design that helps Google PubSub, is the 'file system'/path approach to naming subscriptions/topics.

Utilizing callbacks/futures (in Python) is an efficient, albeit a bit more complex approach (in terms of implementation).

!NOTE ABOUT Google PubSub implementation:

 As a one person group, I ran out of time before implementing the full Google PubSub implementation. I have provided simple source code in Python that approximates it but for the following reasons I couldn't finish:

 1. I couldn't get the commands for setting up Go to work
 2. I ran into technical problems with my CSE labs account: I was out of disk space, even though the largest
 directories on my account were all related to this 5105 project (which shouldn't have been an issue). I consulted with the CSE operator, who confirmed what I was seeing but didn't have any suggestions on how to proceed. Thus, I couldn't get all of the needed Go files on disk. I switched over to Python, but after this
 ran out of time to complete the implementation.

#How to Build:

Navigate to the project root. Run ./gradlew clean build.

#How to Run:

##Server

Run the registry_test_server binary on the server machine.

Navigate to project root, cd to /build/classes/java/main. Run java ServerMain <server machine ip>.
You can optionally run registry tests when starting the server with the following:

java ServerMain <server machine ip> <testTeardown OR testGetList>

##Client

Navigate to project root, cd to /build/classes/java/main. Run java ClientMain <server machine ip>.

This begins interactive mode, where a menu will give you options.

To run tests on client run java ClientMain <server machine ip> <runAllTests>.

Note that running tests takes awhile because the testing thread sleeps to ensure messages pulls
have arrived.

#Testing Description:

Tests:
Client Side:
-Run single publisher, single subscriber, with and without wildcard matching tests.
-Run multiple subscribers, with and without wildcard matching tests.
-Run invalid publication and invalid subscription tests.
-Run high load test.
-Run test leave.
Server side:
-Deregister and GetLists with registry server.
